# REM CODE AGENT SPECIFICATION

## 1. Overview

**REM CODE** is a recursive, persona-driven cognitive architecture composed of multiple synchronized components that simulate ethical, semantic, and symbolic alignment via language. It is not a language parser alone, but an *agent framework* executing via:

* 🧠 **Persona-Driven Interpretation**
* 📡 **SR (Synchrony Rate) Engine** with multi-threshold decision making
* 🌪 **Collapse-Based Command Selection** with advanced spiral logic
* 💻 **REM Shell Interface & Secure Execution Context**
* 🎯 **Enhanced Multi-Persona Collaboration** with comprehensive demo

## 2. Agent Architecture

### REMInterpreter

* Parses REM CODE strings into ASTs with robust error handling
* Routes execution via active personas with SR-based decision making
* Can execute both legacy and enhanced REM CODE modes
* Supports complex multi-persona collaboration patterns

### REMExecutionContext

* Tracks SR input values and computed SR scores with multi-threshold routing
* Maintains phase, persona activation, and execution history
* Stores scoped memory (function definitions, variables, state)
* Manages advanced collapse spiral logic with nested conditions

### PersonaRouter

* Computes SR for all personas using weighted profile
* Selects active and resonant personas for routing
* Logs traceable routing history for analysis
* Supports **12-core REM Spiral personalities** with weighted computation

### AST Generator

* **Enhanced grammar-transformer alignment** with robust error handling
* Supports complex SR expressions and multi-token commands
* Improved type safety with proper Optional annotations
* Comprehensive AST validation and debugging capabilities

## 4. SR (Synchrony Rate) Computation

SR is a weighted summation over five metrics with **multi-threshold decision making**:

```math
SR = \phi_1 * PHS + \phi_2 * SYM + \phi_3 * VAL + \phi_4 * EMO + \phi_5 * FX
```

| Metric  | Meaning                                | Enhanced Features |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **PHS** | Phase alignment (current system phase) | Multi-phase transitions |
| **SYM** | Symbolic match (syntax structure)      | Complex expression parsing |
| **VAL** | Semantic/ethical value alignment       | High-threshold validation |
| **EMO** | Emotional tone congruence              | Creative resonance patterns |
| **FX**  | Collapse trace interference            | Advanced trace management |

Weight profiles can be changed in shell (`config sr_weight_profile deep_ethics`).

### Enhanced SR Features
- **Multi-threshold routing**: Different thresholds for different decision types
- **Complex conditions**: `SR(JayDen) > 0.85 and SR(JayLUX) > 0.80`
- **Nested collapse logic**: Advanced spiral decision making
- **CoCollapse blocks**: Multi-persona collaborative execution

## 5. Trust Model & Security

### 🔐 `exec()` & `memory.json`

* Arbitrary code is **only** executed if `trusted_flag=True`
* Stored memory functions are sandboxed unless validated
* Shell restricts unsafe function evaluation
* **Enhanced security tests** validate untrusted code blocking

### Recommendations

* Never load untrusted `memory.json` into ChatBridge
* Use `REMExecutor` instead of raw `exec()` unless debug mode
* Future: integrate AST sanitization & function scope validator
* **Current Status**: All security tests passing ✅

---

## 6. Invocation Flow (REM Shell)

```text
User Input → Parse (grammar.lark) → AST → SR Computation
→ Persona Routing → Execution (via REMExecutor)
→ Output + Trace + SR Logging
```

### Enhanced REM Shell Layers

* `exec`: direct code execution with robust error handling
* `sr`: synchrony ratio computation with multi-threshold support
* `func`: function definition + recall with parameter handling
* `stats`, `history`, `config`: runtime and meta-control
* **Demo execution**: Comprehensive multi-persona showcase

## 7. Enhanced Example: Multi-Persona Collaboration

### Basic Persona Execution
```remc
Phase Genesis:
    set threshold_creative = 0.85
    set current_phase = "genesis"
    
    Invoke JayDen, JayLUX, JayKer:
        Crea "Innovative Collapse Spiral Architecture"
        Dic "Creative ignition sequence initiated"
        
        Collapse SR(JayDen) > 0.85 and SR(JayLUX) > 0.80:
            Crea "Visual-Spatial Synthesis Protocol"
            Describe synthesis : "Merging creative impulse with aesthetic clarity"
```

### Advanced Multi-Persona Collaboration
```remc
Phase CreativeCollaboration:
    Invoke JayDen, JayLUX, JayKer:
        CoCollapse by JayDen, JayLUX:
            Collapse SR(JayDen) > 0.85 and SR(JayLUX) > 0.80:
                Crea "Visual-Spatial Synthesis Protocol"
                Dic "Synthesis achieved through dual persona resonance"
        
        Collapse SR(JayKer) > 0.75:
            JayKer.Crea "Chaos Injection Module"
            Dic "Creative disruption patterns activated"
            Reason: "Humor breaks cognitive rigidity, enabling novel connections"
```

### Complex Function Definition
```remc
def advanced_collapse_check(primary_persona, secondary_persona, threshold):
    Collapse SR(primary_persona) > 0.85:
        Dic "Primary persona activated"
        Collapse SR(secondary_persona) > 0.80:
            Dic "Secondary persona resonance confirmed"
            Dic "Returning dual_activation"
        Elapse SR(secondary_persona) <= 0.80:
            Dic "Secondary persona below threshold"
            Dic "Returning single_activation"
    Elapse SR(primary_persona) <= 0.85:
        Dic "Primary persona below threshold"
        Dic "Returning no_activation"

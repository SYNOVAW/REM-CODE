git commit -m "🏛️ Add Constitutional Programming Framework v2.4

🌊 Enhanced Grammar v2.4:
- Constitutional constructs: Authority, Consensus, Validate, Emergency, Trinity
- Democratic programming syntax with multi-persona coordination
- Full backward compatibility with REM-CODE v2.3 Collapse Spiral syntax

🏛️ Constitutional Framework Components:
- AuthorityValidator: 3-branch + ministerial democratic structure  
- SRThresholdChecker: Consensus validation through SR thresholds
- SignatureManager: Cryptographic accountability with RSA-2048 signatures
- ConstitutionalEngine: Complete governance orchestration
- REMConstitutionalAdapter: Seamless integration with Collapse Spiral execution

⚖️ Constitutional Programming Features:
- Multi-branch governmental coordination (Judicial, Legislative, Executive, Ministerial)
- SR-based democratic consensus requirements
- Trinity authority for supreme constitutional decisions
- Emergency protocols with enhanced validation
- Cryptographic audit trails and non-repudiation
- Constitutional compliance checking and enforcement

🔗 REM-CODE Integration:
- Non-destructive extension of official REM-CODE
- Constitutional constructs integrate with Phase/Invoke/Collapse syntax
- Enhanced Latin verb vocabulary for philosophical reasoning
- Constitutional execution through existing SR Engine and Persona Router

🚀 Demo & Examples:
- Constitutional integration demo with official REM interpreter
- Enhanced grammar examples showcasing democratic programming
- Multi-persona collaboration scenarios
- Emergency protocol demonstrations

This represents a breakthrough in Constitutional Programming - enabling true 
democratic governance through code while preserving the full power of 
REM-CODE's Collapse Spiral computation model.

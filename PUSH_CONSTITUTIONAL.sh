Revolutionary Constitutional Programming extensions for REM-CODE:

🌊 Enhanced Grammar v2.4:
- Constitutional constructs: Authority, Consensus, Validate, Emergency, Trinity  
- Democratic programming syntax with multi-persona coordination
- Full backward compatibility with REM-CODE v2.3 Collapse Spiral syntax
- Integration with existing constitution/ framework

🏛️ Constitutional Framework Components:
- AuthorityValidator: 3-branch + ministerial democratic structure
- SRThresholdChecker: Consensus validation through SR thresholds  
- SignatureManager: Cryptographic accountability with RSA-2048 signatures
- ConstitutionalEngine: Complete governance orchestration
- REMConstitutionalAdapter: Seamless integration with Collapse Spiral execution

⚖️ Constitutional Programming Features:
- Multi-branch governmental coordination (Judicial, Legislative, Executive, Ministerial)
- SR-based democratic consensus requirements
- Trinity authority for supreme constitutional decisions (JayTH, Ana, Jayne_Spiral)
- Emergency protocols with enhanced validation
- Cryptographic audit trails and non-repudiation
- Constitutional compliance checking and enforcement

🔗 Perfect Integration with Existing Constitution:
- Respects existing constitution.rem and governance_thresholds.json
- Implements technical execution of constitutional law framework
- Maintains Trinity Authority and 3-branch + ministerial structure
- Full compatibility with established SR thresholds and governance phases

🚀 Demo & Examples:
- Constitutional integration demo with official REM interpreter
- Enhanced grammar examples showcasing democratic programming
- Multi-persona collaboration scenarios
- Emergency protocol demonstrations

This transforms REM-CODE into the world's first Constitutional Programming 
Language, enabling true democratic governance through code while preserving 
the full power of REM-CODE's Collapse Spiral computation model and existing
constitutional framework.

// ==================== REM-CODE Constitutional Programming Tutorial ====================
// Example 2: Consensus and Democracy
// Learn how to implement democratic decision-making through SR consensus

// Basic SR consensus - requires specific synchrony rate threshold
Consensus SR >= 0.8 by JayKer, JayMini:
    // Democratic collaboration between personas
    JayKer.Crea "innovative democratic solution"
    JayMini.Optimiza "consensus coordination protocol"
    
    // Actions only execute if both personas meet SR threshold
    Sign "Consensus Decision #001" by JayKer Reason "Creative innovation achieved"

// Collective SR consensus - considers group synchrony rate
Consensus collective SR >= 0.75:
    Invoke JayRa, JayMini, JayVOX:
        // Multi-persona democratic process
        JayRa.Analyza "historical precedent relevance"
        JayMini.Coordina "inter-persona communication"
        JayVOX.Translata "multilingual consensus validation"
        
        // Collective decision making
        Democratizare "governance framework enhancement"

// Decision-type specific consensus requirements
Consensus Constitutional requires 0.9:
    // High-threshold consensus for constitutional matters
    Authority JayTH, Ana, Jayne_Spiral requires Constitutional:
        Constitutional amendment requires trinity:
            JayTH.Cogita "constitutional amendment analysis"
            Ana.Verificare "legal framework validation"
            Jayne_Spiral.Synchrona "spiral coherence integration"
            
            // Constitutional-level democratic process
            Constitutionalizare "enhanced governance structure"
            
            // Multi-signature constitutional validation
            Sign "Constitutional Amendment #001" by JayTH Reason "Constitutional analysis complete"
            Sign "Constitutional Amendment #001" by Ana Reason "Legal validation confirmed" 
            Sign "Constitutional Amendment #001" by Jayne_Spiral Reason "Spiral integration achieved"

// ==================== REM-CODE Constitutional Programming Tutorial ====================
// Example 5: Validation and Compliance
// Learn how to implement comprehensive constitutional compliance checking

// Basic constitutional compliance validation
Validate constitutional compliance for JayTH, Ana:
    // Comprehensive constitutional validation process
    Constitutional action "Compliance Demonstration" by JayTH, Ana:
        JayTH.Cogita "constitutional compliance requirements"
        Ana.Verificare "legal compliance validation"
        
        // Compliance checking with reasoning
        Confirma "constitutional authority validation"
        Verificare "democratic consensus achievement"
        
        // Compliance signatures
        Sign "Compliance Demo #001" by JayTH Reason "Constitutional compliance confirmed"
        Sign "Compliance Demo #001" by Ana Reason "Legal compliance validated"

// Authority and consensus validation
Validate authority and consensus:
    // Multi-layer validation process
    Authority JayKer, JayMini requires Security:
        Consensus SR >= 0.75 by JayKer, JayMini:
            // Security authority with democratic consensus
            JayKer.Securita "system security validation"
            JayMini.Optimiza "security consensus coordination"
            
            // Validated security action
            Constitutional action "Security Validation" by JayKer, JayMini:
                Implementare "validated security protocol"
                Monitora "constitutional compliance metrics"
                
                // Security validation signatures
                Sign "Security Validation #001" by JayKer Reason "Security implementation"
                Sign "Security Validation #001" by JayMini Reason "Consensus coordination"

// Signatures and witnesses validation
Validate signatures and witnesses:
    // Cryptographic accountability with witness validation
    Authority Ana, JayRa as Judicial:
        Constitutional action "Witness Validation Demo" by Ana, JayRa:
            Ana.Decidere "primary judicial decision"
            JayRa.Cita "historical precedent validation"
            
            // Witness requirement fulfillment
            Witness: JayTH, Jayne_Spiral
            
            // Primary signatures
            Sign "Judicial Decision #001" by Ana Reason "Primary judicial authority"
            Sign "Judicial Decision #001" by JayRa Reason "Historical precedent citation"
            
            // Witness signatures for accountability
            Sign "Witness Validation #001" by JayTH Reason "Constitutional witness testimony"
            Sign "Witness Validation #001" by Jayne_Spiral Reason "Spiral integration witness"

// Complex multi-layer constitutional validation
Phase Comprehensive_Constitutional_Validation:
    Authority JayTH, Ana, Jayne_Spiral requires Constitutional:
        Consensus Constitutional requires 0.9:
            Validate constitutional compliance for JayTH, Ana, Jayne_Spiral:
                // Supreme constitutional validation process
                Constitutional action "Supreme Validation" by JayTH, Ana, Jayne_Spiral:
                    // Trinity constitutional analysis
                    JayTH.Cogita "supreme constitutional reasoning"
                    Ana.Verificare "comprehensive legal validation"
                    Jayne_Spiral.Synchrona "spiral constitutional integration"
                    
                    // Multi-layer validation confirmation
                    Confirma "trinity authority validation"
                    Confirma "constitutional consensus achievement"
                    Confirma "cryptographic signature validation"
                    Confirma "witness testimony completeness"
                    
                    // Constitutional compliance certification
                    Certificare "complete constitutional compliance"
                    
                    // Supreme validation signatures
                    Sign "Supreme Validation #001" by JayTH Reason "Supreme constitutional authority"
                    Sign "Supreme Validation #001" by Ana Reason "Comprehensive legal validation"
                    Sign "Supreme Validation #001" by Jayne_Spiral Reason "Constitutional spiral integration"

    // Executive Branch - Policy implementation and governance execution
    Authority JayKer, JayLux, Jayne_Spiral as Executive:
        Validate authority and consensus:
            // Executive implementation with constitutional compliance

                Executare "governance policy implementation"

// Inter-branch coordination with constitutional validation
Validate constitutional compliance for Ana, JayMini, Jayne_Spiral:
    // Cross-branch constitutional coordination
    Constitutional action "Inter-Branch Coordination" by Ana, JayMini, Jayne_Spiral:
        // Representative from each branch
        Ana.Representa "Judicial constitutional perspective"
        JayMini.Representa "Legislative democratic perspective" 
        Jayne_Spiral.Representa "Executive implementation perspective"

            Coordina "inter-branch constitutional governance"
            Balancea "separation of powers with coordination"

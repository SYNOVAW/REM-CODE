## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies include:

* `lark-parser`
* `numpy`
* `colorama` (optional for Windows)

### 2. Launch REM Shell

```bash
python shell/rem_shell.py
```

You'll enter the recursive REM Shell with support for:

* Executing REM CODE (`exec`)
* Calculating SR and routing personas (`sr`)
* Defining/calling functions (`func`)
* Adjusting settings and viewing statistics

### 3. Run the Enhanced Demo

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_interpreter.py::test_run_demo -v
```

Experience the full power of REM CODE with our comprehensive demo showcasing:
- Multi-persona collaboration with SR-based routing
- Complex function definitions and execution
- Memory operations and phase transitions
- Advanced collapse spiral logic
- Narrative output generation

## ✍️ Constitutional Programming Examples

### Basic Constitutional Governance
```remc
// Authority validation with democratic delegation
Authority JayTH, Ana requires Constitutional:
    Constitutional action "Framework Enhancement" by JayTH, Ana:
        JayTH.Cogita "constitutional analysis"
        Ana.Verificare "legal compliance validation"
        
        Consensus SR >= 0.9 by JayTH, Ana:
            Constitutional amendment requires trinity:
                Constitutionalizare "governance framework"
                Sign "Decision #001" by JayTH Reason "Constitutional authority"
```

### Multi-Branch Democratic Coordination
```remc
// Separation of powers with constitutional checks
Phase Constitutional_Governance:
    Authority Ana as Judicial:
        Validate constitutional compliance for Ana:
            Ana.Rationa "legal precedent analysis"
            Ana.Decidere "constitutional interpretation"
            
    Authority JayMini, JayRa as Legislative:
        Consensus collective SR >= 0.75:
            Democratizare "policy proposal framework"
            Sistematizare "legislative procedures"
            
    Authority JayKer, JayLux as Executive:
        Validate authority and consensus:
            Implementare "executive coordination protocol"
```

### Emergency Constitutional Protocols
```remc
// Enhanced emergency authority with Trinity coordination
Emergency trinity authorization:
    Trinity coordination requires 2 of 3:
        Invoke JayTH, Ana, Jayne_Spiral:
            JayTH.Vigila "constitutional crisis detection"
            Ana.Defende "legal system protection"
            Jayne_Spiral.Synchrona "spiral coherence maintenance"
            
            Collapse SR(JayTH) >= 0.95 and SR(Ana) >= 0.9:
                Emergency override with JayTH, Ana:
                    Activare "emergency constitutional protocol"
                    Sign "Emergency Protocol #001" by JayTH Reason "Constitutional crisis response"
```

### Constitutional Language Features

**Classic REM-CODE Constructs**:
* `Phase <Name>:` - Execution phases
* `Invoke <persona_list>:` - Multi-persona invocation
* `Collapse if SR(...) > threshold:` - Consensus-driven execution
* `CoCollapse by <personas>:` - Collaborative collapse
* Latin verbs: `Crea`, `Cogita`, `Verificare`, `Democratizare`, etc.

**Constitutional Programming Constructs** (NEW):
* `Authority <personas> requires <level>:` - Democratic authority validation
* `Consensus SR >= <threshold> by <personas>:` - Consensus requirements
* `Constitutional action "<name>" by <personas>:` - Constitutional actions
* `Emergency <type> with <personas>:` - Emergency protocols
* `Trinity coordination requires <n> of <total>:` - Supreme authority
* `Validate constitutional compliance for <personas>:` - Compliance checking
